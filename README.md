# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine two ways to deal with the rapid retirement of the baby boomers. The first way is to offer a retirement package to the people who are eligible to retire. The second way is to have the people who are thinking about retirement teach the new hires how to do the job. This way the company will not have thousands of job openings and the transition from retirement employees to new employees can be smooth.

## Results
- retirement_titles table had 133776 names. Quantity not directly representative of people retiring due to people changing positions in the company over the years. 

- unique_titles table reduced names to 72458 by having employees number show only once. This is the actual number of people retiring.

- retiring_titles table represents the number of people who are retiring in each position

- mentorship_eligibility table demonstrates the people who are nearing retirement and are able to teach the new employees their job.
